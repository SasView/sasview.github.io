**For Information**

The server is running and the SasView mailing lists are operational again. Thank you for your patience.

2023-08-14:

Due to a technical malfunction on the server, **all** SasView mailing lists (including *help@sasview.org* and *users@sasview.org*)
are currently unavailable. We are working to resolve the problem as soon as possible.

Updates will be posted here.
