[SasView Code Camp X](https://github.com/SasView/sasview/wiki/CodeCampX) will be hosted
at Caltech in Pasadena, CA (USA) from March 18 through 24<sup>th</sup> 2020. 
The SasView community wishes to thank Professor Julia Kornfield for her generous support of this activity.

NOTE: We are hoping to have a pre-Code Camp 'Bootcamp' to cover things like python basics, 
code structures, and using the tools of collaborative development, mainly git/github.

For more details feel free to contact the management team:
[management@sasview.org](mailto:management@sasview.org)
or any of the developers.
