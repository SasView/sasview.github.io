[Version 5.0.0](https://github.com/SasView/sasview/releases/tag/v5.0.0) was
released on May 20, 2019! This Final release marks the first in the brand new
5.x SasView series. The 5.x series has a completely redesigned interface along
with an important new feature: the beta approximation for concentrated systems.
The 4.x series will continue to be supported for a short time and at least one
more minor release, 4.3.0, is expected as we complete the transition. However
all new GUI features are expected to be developed for the 5.x series. Try it 
now and tell us how you like it and let us know of any issues!

For more details, please see the Release Notes which are now available from the
program Help.
