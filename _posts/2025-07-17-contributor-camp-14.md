The 3rd [SasView Contributor Camp](https://github.com/SasView/sasview/wiki/ContributorCampXIV) (formerly known
as Code Camp XIV) will be held November 11-17 2025 at the Technical University of Munich, Garching, near Munich,
Germany. Come join in the fun!

All parties interested in contributing to the SasView project (writing tutorials,
documentation, verifying the math/science, coding, or undertaking sys admin tasks, etc) are
welcome, even encouraged, to join.  See the link below for the latest planning.

One aim is for this Camp is to work on improving support for magnetic SANS in SasView, but 
this is not meant to be exclusionary: as always, those wishing to contribute in other areas
are always welcome!
