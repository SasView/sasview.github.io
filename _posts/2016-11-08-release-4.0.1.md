November 2016: Version 4.0.1 of SasView was released November 8, 2016 - fixes a known issue with P(Q)*S(Q) that appeared in release 4.0.

### What's new in version 4.0.1

*   This point release fixes a critical issue in release 4.0. **All users of 4.0 should upgrade to 4.0.1.**

*   As part of the model structure refactoring a new bug was accidentally introduced that makes P(Q) \* S(Q) unusable unless the background is fixed to zero (the background is multiplied by P(Q) including all the scaling factors). This behaviour is corrected in 4.0.1 and non-zero backgrounds are again possible when using S(Q). The extraneous scaling factors have also been removed.
*   NB: The effective radius used for S(Q) is _still_ calculated (as per the documentation) automatically from P(Q) using the radius of a sphere that has the same second viral coefficient as the particle. This is only valid for particles with limited axial ratios.
