SasView Code Camp X was due to be hosted at Caltech in Pasadena, CA (USA) from 
March 18<sup>th</sup> through 24<sup>th</sup> 2020.

However, due to concerns arising from the Covid-19 outbreak, and the increasing 
restrictions on travel that are being imposed, the SasView team has decided, 
with some regret, that it has no choice but to postpone the Code Camp.

The team will look to run the Code Camp in a few months time, by when conditions 
will hopefully be more conducive.
