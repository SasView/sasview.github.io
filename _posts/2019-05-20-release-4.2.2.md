[Version 4.2.2](https://github.com/SasView/sasview/releases/tag/v4.2.2) was
released on May 20, 2019 as a bug release to [4.2.0](https://github.com/SasView/sasview/releases/tag/v4.2.0).
This release fixes the known issues reported in 4.2.1: the inability to read in
project files due to the fixes (changes) in the NXcanSAS reader, and the fact
that the 2D resolution was only being applied to one quadrant.  Try it now!

For more details, please see the Release Notes which are now available from the
program Help.
