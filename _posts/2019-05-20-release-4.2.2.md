[Version 4.2.2](https://github.com/SasView/sasview/releases/tag/v4.2.2) was
released on May 20, 2019 as a bug release to [4.2.0](https://github.com/SasView/sasview/releases/tag/v4.2.0).
This release fixes the known issues reported in 4.2.1: the inability to read in
project files due to the fixes (changes) in the NXcanSAS reader, and the fact
that the 2D resolution was only being applied to one quadrant.

For more details, please see the Release Notes which are now available from the
program Help.

**IMPORTANT MESSAGE (Feb 2022)**

SasView Version 4.2.2, and all before it, were built using Python 2 which
officially reached its End-of-Life on Jan 1, 2020. Before this happened we
moved all development of SasView to Python 3, starting with version 5.0.0.

You are therefore advised that continued use of SasView 4 is now officially
deprecated and we recommend that you migrate to the latest release version
of SasView 5 at your earliest convenience. The is no active development of
SasView 4, nor has there been since its release.

However, MacOS users should note that in order to run SasView 5 they may
need to upgrade their version of OSX. Please read our Release Notes.

SasView 4 will continue to run on your computer as long as your operating
system will allow it, but how long this will continue for is obviously outside
of the control of the Development Team.
