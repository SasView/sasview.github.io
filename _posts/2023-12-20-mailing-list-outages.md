**For Information**

2024-01-02 (18:30 UTC):

The servers are running and the SasView mailing lists are operational again. Thank you for your patience.


2023-12-20 11:00 UTC:

Due to a technical malfunction on the server, **all** SasView mailing lists (including *help@sasview.org* and *users@sasview.org*)
are currently unavailable. We are working to resolve the problem as soon as possible.

Updates will be posted here.

In addition, planned maintenance work is likely to result in power outages to the SasView servers between 12/27-12/29 2023.
