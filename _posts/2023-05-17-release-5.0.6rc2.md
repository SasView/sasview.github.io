A second release candidate, 5.0.6rc2, for the forthcoming new release can be
downloaded [here](https://github.com/SasView/sasview/releases/tag/v5.0.6rc2).

This rc2 only addresses a small number of issues encountered in rc1.
 
As with the rc1, only Mac & Windows installers are provided. For those of you that
are Linux users, we will provide a conda install for the full release but are not
doing so for these beta releases for technical reasons.
 
Whilst installing the program, please also take a moment to review the accompanying
Release Notes at the link above.
 
**The testing window will run until late May 2023.** Please report any issues
when installing/using the program to the usual help@sasview.org or, if you prefer,
complete a [GitHub bug report](https://github.com/SasView/sasview/issues/new?template=bug_report.md).
 
When reporting back, please make it clear that you are testing version 5.0.6rc2/5.0.6b2
and also provide us with the platform you are using (ie, Windows, Mac) and your specific
operating system version. But it would also be great to hear from you, again including
the platform/OS you use and what parts of SasView you used, if you do not encounter any
problems!
 
Thank you for your continued help and support!
