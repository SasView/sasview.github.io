### What's new in version 3.0.0

*   The GUI look and feel has been refactored to be more familiar for Windows users by using MDI frames. Graph windows are also now free-floating
*   Five new models have been added:
    - PringlesModel (a doubly bent disc)
    - CoreShellEllipsoidXTModel (alternative CoreShellEllipsoid with the axial ratio and shell thickness as parameters)
    - RectangularPrismModel (an extension of the ParallelPipedModel)
    - RectangularHollowPrismModel
    - RectangularHollowPrismInfThinWallsModel

*   The data loader now supports ILL DAT data files and reads the full meta information from canSAS file formats
*   Redefined convention for specifying angular parameters for anisotropic models
*   A number of minor features have been added such as permitting a log distribution of points when using a model to simulate data, and the addition of a Kratky plot option to the linear plots
*   Save Project and Save Analysis now work more reliably
*   A number of bugs have also been fixed
*   _BETA:_ MAGNETIC CONTRAST supporting full polarization analysis has been implemented for some spherical and cylindrical models
*   _BETA:_ Two new tools have been added:
    - A GENERIC SCATTERING CALCULATOR which takes an atomic, magnetic or SLD distribution in space and generates the appropriate 2D scattering pattern. In some cases the orientationally averaged (powder) 1D scattering can also be computed. Supported formats include: SLD or text, PDB, and OMF magnetic moment distribution file.
    - An IMAGE VIEWER/CONVERTER for data in image format; this reads in an image file and will attempt to convert the image pixels to data. Supported formats include: TIFF, TIF, PNG, BMP, JPG.
