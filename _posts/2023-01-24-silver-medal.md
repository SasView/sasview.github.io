A key figure in the SasView story since its inception almost 17 years ago has
been Paul Butler at the NCNR, Gaithersburg, USA.

Paul's committment to SasView, and especially the building of a worldwide
collaboration to further and sustain its development, has been tremendous and
long worthy of recognition.

So it is with great delight that we can announce that Paul has just been awarded
a 2022 Silver Medal by the US Department of Commerce!

Congratulations Paul!
