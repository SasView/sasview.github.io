On June 13 and 14, LINXS held a [magnetic SANS workshop](https://www.linxs.se/events/2022/6/13/linxs-workshop-magnetic-sans-data-analysis-and-software-prospects) in Lund. over the course of 2 days some of the current research in the area, spanning diffraction to diffuse scattering, were presented and the software tools required to simplify the data analysis task were discussed.  The SasView team presented the concept of an “open collaborative community driven development” approach and its advantages along with recent developments of use to the magnetic SANS community. There was a feeling that the new developments in SasView are already quite useful and that there is potential for some other contributions to add some other useful workflows.

The LINXS workshop was immediately followed by a 3 day contributor training/hackathon workshop in which a few of the LINXS participants, along with a couple of other new contributors learned some of the basics of various parts of contributing and used the knowledge to work on real projects. It was quite exciting to see the old “code camp” dynamic back in play with this in-person format.  We look forward now to the resumption of code camps and to working to empower the broader community to contribute.
