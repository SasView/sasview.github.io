[Version 5.0.2](https://github.com/SasView/sasview/releases/tag/v5.0.2) was
released on Apr 23, 2020! This is a point release which fixes several issues
reported in version 5.0.1, however there are also some new features.

For more details, please see the Release Notes which are now available from the
program Help.

Known Issues

A very long-standing error has been identified in the Invariant Analysis
perspective. The value of the specific surface Sv that is being returned
is in fact twice the value that it should be. Work is underway to correct
this and some other deficiencies in the operation of the perspective, but
version 5.0.2 benefits from the significantly enhanced invariant documentation
stemming from this work.

Also, at this time, and unlike version 4.x, only fitting sessions can be saved
as project files. We expect this to be corrected in the next release.
