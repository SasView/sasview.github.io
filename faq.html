 	<h3>Frequently Asked Questions</h3>
	   <p> Here are the answers to some common questions about SasView: </p>
	   
	   <h3> What is SasView? </h3>
			<ul>
	  		    <li> SasView is software for the analysis of Small-Angle Scattering (SAS) data.</li><br>
	  		    <li> It fits analytic functions describing different types of material microstructure to experimental data in order to determine the shape, size and degree of ordering.</li><br>
				<li> SasView also includes tools for calculating  scattering length densities, slit sizes, resolution, fringe thicknesses/d-spacings, the (Porod) invariant ('total scattering'), and distance distribution functions.</li>
			</ul>
	   
	   <h3> What platforms does SasView run on? </h3>
			<ul>
				<li> Windows</li>
				<ul>
                    <li>SasView 2.x: 32-bit.</li>
                    <li>SasView 3.x and later: 32-bit & 64-bit.</li>
				</ul>
				<li> Mac OS</li>
				<ul>
                    <li>SasView 3.x and earlier: 32-bit OSX (10.6, Snowleopard).</li>
                    <li>SasView 4.x and later: 64-bit OSX (10.9, Mavericks or later).</li>
				</ul>
				<li> Linux</li>
				<ul>
					<li> We do not currently support a Linux distribution.</li>
					<li> SasView is being built under Ubuntu on the development servers but is mostly aspirational at present due to limited developer resources.  In fact the eggs produced do not currently appear to be usable.  We hope to eventually be able to distribute on Linux and welcome anyone interested in helping with that project to join us.</li>
					<li> In the meantime you are welcome to try building SasView from source available on the release pages: <a href="https://github.com/SasView/sasview/releases">https://github.com/SasView/sasview/releases</a> and run &lsquo;python setup.py build&rsquo;. If all goes well, executing &lsquo;python run.py&rsquo; should run SasView. Some people have reported success with this.</li><br />
				</ul>
			</ul>
       
       <h3> Can SasView make use of my GPU(s)? </h3>
            <ul>
                <li> GPU support is only available in SasView 4.x and later.</li>
                <li> If a GPU is available then SasView will attempt to use it <i>by default</i> if a suitable driver is also installed. See the SasView Help documentation for further information.</li>
            </ul>
       
       <h3> Can I stop SasView trying to use my GPU(s)? </h3>
            <ul>
                <li> Yes. Create a system environment variable called SAS_OPENCL and give it the value 'None'.</li>
            </ul>
       
       <h3> Can I use SasView to analyse SANS/USANS data? </h3>

			</ul>
	   
	   <h3> What units should my data be in? </h3>
			<ul>
			<h3> Q data </h3>
	  		    <li> SasView assumes that Q data is in units of /Angstroms. If your Q data is in units of /nm (or anything else) you will get incorrect parameters from your model fits. <i>However</i> if your data is in <a href="http://www.cansas.org">canSAS</a> format and the Q unit is specified as /nm - ie, the XML specifies Q unit="1/nm" - SasView will internally convert the Q data to &Aring. </li>
			</ul>

			<ul>
			<h3> I(Q) data </h3>
	  		    <li> SasView makes no assumptions about the units of I(Q) data, <i>but</i> your model fits will only return meaningful scale parameters (ie, volume fractions) if the I(Q) data is in absolute units (/cm) and on an absolute scale (ie, the I(Q) values have been calibrated against a standard). </li>
			</ul>
			
	   <h3> Many models have a <i>scale</i> parameter; what is this? </h3>
			<ul>
	  		    <li> If your I(Q) data is in absolute units (/cm) and on an absolute scale (ie, the I(Q) values have been calibrated against a standard) the scale parameter will be equal to the volume fraction. In all other instances the scale factor will be a number proportional to the volume fraction. Some models have both volume fraction and scale parameters. In these models the scale is just a multiplying factor (equal to 1 if the data is in absolute units on an absolute scale). </li><br>
				<li> We are aware that some of the model descriptions in the 'help file' are unclear about the meaning of <i>scale</i> and are working to improve the documentation.</li>
			</ul>

			<h3> How can I put my data on an absolute intensity scale? </h3>
			<ul>
	  		    <li> By comparing the intensity of scattering from your samples with that from a standard sample measured under identical conditions with the same instrument geometry. In most instances it will be a simple linear scaling, <i>provided</i> the sample and standard transmissions (transmission = 1 - absorbtion) have been accounted for during the data reduction. Consult your beamline scientist/local contact. </li>
			</ul>
			
			<h3> Why do I get non-sensical parameter values if I try to simultaneously model-fit the scale factor and the scattering length densities? </h3>
			<ul>
	  		    <li> Because these parameters are correlated. You must either fix the scale or the scattering length densities (at least, until your fit has almost converged). </li>
			</ul>
			
	   <h3> What value should I use to specify polydispersity? </h3>
			<ul>
	  		    <li> This will depend on the actual type of polydispersity function you choose, but will be related to some ratio of the 'width' of the size distribution and the mean value of the parameter that the polydispersity is being enabled for (eg, a particle radius). For example, for a Schulz polydispersity function the PD parameter in SasView is standard_deviation/average_value. In most (meaningful) instances 0 <= PD < 1. </li>
			</ul>
			
	   <h3> Is the Schulz(-Zimm) polydispersity function used in SasView a number-average or a weight-average distribution? </h3>
			<ul>
	  		    <li> <b>SasView assumes the underlying polydispersity function is a number-distribution</b> and therefore the reported mean from that distribution is a number-average parameter. But SasView does properly weight the function by volume when fitting to the scattering data as is required to fit data in absolute units. </li><br>
				<li> <i>However</i>, it is also clear that the literature has conflicting views about what the correct form of a number-average Schulz distribution should be. In essence there are <i>two</i> different distributions which are being called the Schulz distribution. These are unfortunately related through mass. SasView, like several other well-known and well-used model-fitting packages, uses the form of the distribution given in the M. Kotlarchyk & S-H. Chen paper (J. Chem. Phys. 79 (1983) 2461-2469) which specifically identifies it as a number-average distribution. This is also the same Schulz number-average distribution given by Aragon & Pecora (J. Chem. Phys. 1976) and Bartlett and Ottewill (J. Chem. Phys. 1992), among others. On the other hand, the earlier papers using this distribution were specifically applied to degrees of polymerization and were clear that they viewed the equivalent formula to be a weight-average distribution. It now seems that at least Welch & Bloomfield (J. Pol. Sci. 1973) and Huber (2012) use the same equation as Aragon & Pecora's number-average formula but define it as a weight-average formula and then derive a new number-average formula from this.</li><br>
                <li> (February 2015) After further investigation we have concluded that our implementation of the Schulz polydispersity function is sound. Our definition of the <i>z</i> parameter, describing the width of the distribution, has exactly the same mathematical form whether defined as a number-average of a number-average distribution or as a weight-average of a weight-average distribution. But in some papers <i>z</i> is defined as <i>z+1</i> which clearly would give a different mathematical behaviour.</li>
			</ul>

       <h3> What about the other polydispersity functions used in SasView? </h3>
            <ul>
                <li> These are implemented as number-distributions also. </li>
			</ul>
			
	   <h3> How do I load an image file as data? </h3>
			<ul>
	  		    <li> Use 'Tool' > 'Image Viewer' and **not** 'File' > 'Load Data File(s)' or the 'Load Data' button on the Data Explorer. </li>
	  		    <li> SasView will load .BMP, .GIF, .JPG, .PNG and .TIF formats. </li>
			</ul>
			
	   <h3> Where do the model parameter uncertainties come from? </h3>
			<ul>
	  		    <li> How the parameter uncertainties (commonly, but wrongly, called the parameter errors) are estimated depends on the fitting algorithm used. One estimate of uncertainty is to use the square root of the diagonal of the covariance matrix.  This can give a good estimate if the uncertainty is well behaved, with no significant correlation between the parameters.  The covariance matrix is calculated as part of the commonly used Levenberg-Marquardt optimizer, which is provided by the <a href=http://docs.scipy.org/doc/scipy/reference/generated/scipy.optimize.leastsq.html>Python SciPy library</a>).   Otherwise the covariance matrix is estimated using the numerical derivative at the best point.  If you <i>really</i> want to know more, check out this <a href=http://www.aps.anl.gov/Xray_Science_Division/Powder_Diffraction_Crystallography/3LeastSquaresIntro/3LeastSquaresIntro.pdf">handy tutorial</a> by Brian Toby at APS. The DREAM optimizer uses a Monte Carlo approach which provides a more realistic estimate of the uncertainties for the case when uncertainties are not well behaved. </li>
			</ul>
			
	   <h3> Why do I get different parameter uncertainties using the Simple and Complex fitting engines? </h3>
			<ul>
	  		    <li> <i>This applies to SasView 3.0.0 and earlier.</i></li>
	  		    <li> To a first approximation, the two fitting engines should return similar, but not identical, parameter uncertainties. The Simple engine uses the Python SciPy library which computes the Jacobian using the <i>forward difference formula</i> and evaluates the covariance matrix by QR decomposition. The Complex engine computes the Jacobian using the <i>centre point formula</i> and evaluates the covariance matrix by singular value decomposition (SV). Both methods will also be affected by the accuracy of the numerical differentiation procedures and the precision of the floating point computations.  </li><br>
				<li> (July 2014) We have discovered an inconsistency in the way that the Simple and Complex fitting engines define the reduced chi-square in SasView 3.0.0 and earlier. The consequence of this is that the Complex engine is not performing as many iterations as it should and is thus returning parameter uncertainties that are perhaps a factor 5 to 10 larger than expected. A solution is under consideration. </li>
			</ul>
			
	   <h3> Why is SasView not loading the model parameters from some of my existing .fitv (Save Fit) files? </h3>
			<ul>
	  		    <li> As the number of models implemented in SasView increased it became necessary to add additional categorisation. At the same time we gave the user the ability to customise the categorisation (the Modify Category button). Unfortunately this does mean that the categorisation of <i>some</i> models will have changed between earlier versions of SasView (when it was still called SansView) and recent releases. When SasView cannot determine the model categorisation from a .fitv file it attempts to default to the first model in the first category. There are two workarounds to this issue: </li><br>
					<ul>
					<li> 1) Open the .fitv file in a text editor and scroll down to the section headed <i>Attributes</i>. Above the entry <i>formfactorcombobox</i> create a new entry <i>categorycombobox categorycombobox="type"</i>, where <i>type</i> is the category that the model was originally in (current categories are: Shape-Independent, Shapes, Structure Factor, Uncategorized, Custom Models). Make sure you enclose your new entry in angle brackets just like the existing entries! </li>
					<li> 2) Use the Modify Category button in the recent version of SasView to move the model you want to use to the category it used to be in.
					</ul>
			</ul>
            
       <h3> Why is Save Analysis (File menu) greyed out after I fit a model? </h3>
            <ul>
                <li> At present Save Analysis gets greyed out if you click on a graph window after fitting a model. We agree this is not very sensible behaviour and will rectify it in a future bug release. In the meantime, use the 'Save' icon in the graphical toolbar to generate .fitv files. </li>
            </ul>
            
       <h3> Why doesn't Check for Updates work? </h3>
            <ul>
                <li> Check for Updates compares the version (not build) number of your copy of SasView with that in the code repository. If SasView cannot access the remote server the message <i>'Cannot connect to the application server'</i> is displayed in the status bar.</li>
                <li> Prior to version 3.1.1., the most common reason for Check for Updates failing was that your internet connection used a proxy server and your operating system had not been fully configured to use that proxy server. It is entirely possible to be able to use a web browser to surf the internet but find that SasView cannot read the current version number from the code repository! We believe this is fixed in 3.1.1. How you remedy this if you have a lower version (and don't want to update) depends on your operating system:</li>
                <ul>
                    <h3> Windows 7:</h3>
                    <li> Warning! The following procedure involves changing system settings. If you are not confident about doing so, consult your local IT Helpdesk.</li>
                    <li> If you are not sure if your internet connect uses a proxy server, click on the Start button, select 'Network and Internet' and then 'Internet Options'. Now click the 'Connections' tab and then the button 'LAN settings'.</li>
                    <ol>
                        <li> Click on the Start button. In the 'search programs and files' box type 'regedit' and press {return}.</li>
                        <li> In the Registry Editor, navigate to the registry key (be careful not to find find a similar key by mistake) <b>HKEY_CURRENT_USER\Software\Microsoft\Windows\CurrentVersion\Internet Settings</b>. Look for a setting named 'ProxyServer'. If it exists, ensure it both points to your proxy server and has a port number appended. If it is missing create this setting as follows:</li>
                        <ul>
                             <li> Edit > New > String Value. Right-click on 'New Value' and rename it to 'ProxyServer'. Right-click again, choose 'Modify', and in the 'Value data' box type the address and port number of your proxy server (eg, http://proxy.uni.edu:port).</li>
                        </ul>
                        <li> If your internet connection <i>also</i> uses a proxy auto-configuration (or .pac) file (see the instructions above for how to check), also check for the presence of a setting 'AutoConfigURL'. Again, if this exists, ensure it points at the right address and file. If it is missing, create this setting (eg, http://proxy.uni.edu/configproxy.pac) in the same manner as above.</li>
                        <li> Note that the value (0 or 1) of the REG_DWORD called 'ProxyEnable' appears to be irrelevant!</li>
                        <li> Close the Registry Editor.</li>
                        <li> Click on the Start button. In the 'search programs and files' box type 'environment variables' and press {return}.</li>
                        <li> In the Environment Variables panel, check the <i>User</i> variables (not System variables) for HTTP_PROXY and HTTPS_PROXY. If they exist, ensure that both specify your username, proxy server and port. If they are missing, create these variables as follows:</li>
                        <ul>
                             <li> Click 'New'. Enter HTTP_PROXY as the 'Variable name'. Enter a 'Variable value' of the form: username@proxy.uni.edu:port. Click 'Ok'. Repeat the process to create the variable HTTPS_PROXY. Click 'Ok'.</li>
                        </ul>                  
                    </ol>
                    <li> Check for Updates should now work.</li>
                </ul> 
            </ul>

       <h3> Why is SasView no longer able to run my existing custom models? </h3>
            <ul>
                <li> There may be two reasons for this. From release 4.0 the structure of plug-in models altered considerably in order to provide the enhanced functionality (access to polydispersity, etc) many of our users had demanded. Though we have attempted to provide some degree of internal translation, the reality is that this will likely only be truly successful for simple models. We recommend that old models be re-written to comply with the requirements of the new architcture. New models can then be contributed through our new <a href="http://marketplace.sasview.org">Model Marketplace</a>.</li>
                <li> The last vestiges of the old SansView name leftover from the genesis of the application were removed for release 3.1.  While most visible parts of the application had already been converted to sasview prior to version 3.0, some of the packages still had the prefix "sans", including unfortunately the package used in custom models "sans.models.pluginmodel."  In order to fix this simply apply the following fix.  We appologize for the inconvenience. </li><br>
                    <ul>
                    <li> under <i>Fitting --> Edit Custom Model --> Advanced</i> (on the menu bar) open the offending custom model.  Find any import statements (should be at the beginning) including the <b>from sans.models.pluginmodel import Model1DPlungin</b> and replace "sans" with "sas."  Save the model.  It should now work</li>
                    </ul>
            </ul>

       <h3> Does SasView fit data in its I vs Q representation, or as Log I vs Log Q? </h3>
            <ul>
                <li> SasView fits data in the form it is supplied on loading, so usually as I vs Q. But the default behaviour of the program is to display the data and fit as Log I vs Log Q.</li> 
                <li> If you want to change how the data and fit are displayed, right-click on the plot and choose <i>Change Scale</i>.</li>
                     <ul>
                     <li><i>NB: when using log representation, SasView applies Log10 and not Loge.</i></li>
                     </ul>
            </ul>

       <h3> How can I see the separate contributions of the form factor and structure factor? </h3>
            <ul>
                <h3> SasView 2.x.x / SasView 3.x.x / SasView 4.0.x:</h3>
                <li> Load the data and perform the fit as normal, including the structure factor. Go to the menubar and select <i>Edit --> Copy Params...</i>.</li> 
                <li> Then open two new Fit Pages (<i>Fitting --> New Fit Page</i>). In one of the new Fit Pages select the form factor model you used in the first Fit Page, in the other new Fit Page select the structure factor model you used in the first Fit Page.</li>
                <li> In each of the two new Fit Pages, select <i>Edit --> Paste Params...</i>.</li>
                     <ul>
                     <li><i>NB: depending on the version of SasView you are using (4.0.x versus earlier versions), it may be necessary to manually adjust the scale factors or volume fraction parameter so that only one or other reports the volume fraction.</i></li>
                     </ul>
                <li> In each of the two new Fit Pages, click Compute. The form factor and structure factor will appear as Theories in the Data Explorer panel.</li>
                <h3> SasView 4.1 and later:</h3>
                <li> Once a fit has been performed P(Q), and S(Q) if included in the fit, will appear under Theories in the Data Explorer panel. </li>
            </ul>

       <h3> How can I include a structure factor in a model? </h3>
            <ul>
                <li> There are two ways to include an S(Q) in a model:</li>
                     <ul>
                     <li>By clicking on the S(Q) drop-down box adjacent to the P(Q) model choice in a FitPage</li>
                     <li>Using the Sum|Multi function under Custom/Plugin Model operations.</li>

                <li> However, these two methods are not equivalent.</li>
                <li> When you choose to implement S(Q) from the FitPage, the effective radius for the particle described by P(Q) is calculated automatically and the volume fraction used in S(Q) is set to be the volume fraction of the particles (ie, the 'scale' parameter). Behind the scenes, the model calculates the radius of a sphere that would have the same second virial coefficient as the chosen particles and uses that in the S(Q) calculation as the effective radius for the interaction potential. This method works well for particles with an axial ratio up to about a 3-to-1 but beyond that is not correct.</li>
                <li> When you make a Custom/Plugin model, the full set of parameters for calculating S(Q) are made available and you need to have an idea of what the effective radius and effective volume fraction for your chosen particles should be.</li>
                <li> All S(Q) functions available in SasView were derived for spherical particles.</li>
                <li> Also be aware that if you create a Custom/Plugin model from two other Custom/Plugin models with S(Q) included, for example, something like P1(Q)S1(Q) + P2(Q)S2(Q), SasView will only take account of the 'self' interactions. If you <i>also</i> need to properly account for the 'cross' interactions you will need to program a Custom/Plugin model from first principles.</li>

       <h3> What is the Model Marketplace? </h3>
            <ul>
                <li> The <a href="http://marketplace.sasview.org">Model Marketplace</a> is an open repository of SasView fitting models we have set up to allow the SAS Community to contribute and share models. </li>
                <li> Despite its name, it is free to use! </li>
            </ul>
