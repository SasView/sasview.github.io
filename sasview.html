		 <blockquote><i>This work benefitted from SasView software,originally developed by the DANSE project under NSF award DMR-0520547</i></blockquote>  


				 <h3>Current Scope and Functionality</h3>

				 <p>SasView is an open source project currently hosted at souceforge.  The software is written in Python with C and C++ modules providing some of the heavier computations.  Persons interested in becoming developers should contact one of the project administrators.  Comments, suggestions, and contributions are also welcome and can be made by emailing the development team at help@sasview.org.</p>
  
				<p>SAS analyis is a fairly broad term, potentially covering a huge amount of ground and often meaning different things to different people.  As part of this project several boundaries were identified and defined.  The first boundary is the distinction between SAS reduction and SAS analysis.  Reduction is defined as the process that removes all instrument specific "artifacts" and produces a reduced data set containing only the "science" of the material being investigated.  If done perfectly reduced data from any instrument should lie on top of one another with minor caveats regarding differences in the contrast term arising out of the use of different types of radiation.  The Rationale is that every instrument is different and every source is different.  Thus reduction will always be a process relatively unique to the instrument on which the data was taken and only the facilitie's instrument scientists are truly qualified to know what all those details are.  By contrast, once in reduced form, the job of the user scientist can begin in earnest as that is the data that contains the information he/she is seeking. Furhter, at this point the "analysis" problem becomes a completely common and generic problem so that all facilities and the community at large can easily collaborate having now the exact same needs.  There are grey areas where the distinction is not as clear. However we believe in most cases the problem can be reduced to this separation.  SasView is designed to operate on <b>reduced</b> data and thus should be instrument agnostic.
				<p> The second distinction demarcation is between real space and inverse space analysis.  By inverse space analysis we mean the process of thinking about data in inverse space as collected, while by real space analysis we mean the process of thinking about the data in real 3D space.  The first case represnts the traditional approach to SAS analyis used by colloid and materials scientists while the second has been pioneered mostly by the bilogical scattering community.  We believe that these are two very different (if complementary) ways of thinking about the problem and it would be very difficult to create a single user interface ideal for both.  Thus SasView is designed as an inverse space modeling tool.  We hope to build partnerships to interact with real space analysis packages such as the <a href="http://www.smallangles.net/sassie/">SASSIE project</a>, providing if appropriate support in making them relevant beyond biological system. Two methods cross this boundary: P(R) analysis which attempts a direct inversion of the data to real space with no a priori assumptions, and shape reconstruction or "abintio" methods which seek to refine an arbitrary 3D real space model (again with no a priori knowldege) till its Fourier inversion fits the scattering data. The first metod is incorporated into SasView.  At this time the second is thought to be mor appropriate for the real space analyis packages.  The philosophy is to try to balance the desire to do all one's analysis in one package with the need to keep the interface somewhat intuitive and easy to learn and use.  The hope is to achieve this balance by packaging all the functionality likely to be wanted by most users of this package most of the time and to design and build interfaces with complementary packages to allow data to be moved transparently across applications when needed.</p>
	<p>SasView will read almost any 1D ASCII column data but currently does not support metadata.  Due to the lack of standard 2D reduced date formats, Sasview currently reads NIST reduced 2D formats.  The plan is to read the canSAS 2D format once it becomes ratified.  SasView was developed with a view to take advantage of modern computing power to make analysis of non-azimuthally symmetric 2D data (such as obtained under the influence of a directional field such as flow, or magnetic or electric fields more routine.  Primary Features: Freely available,including source code (SVN repository at source forge); One click install for Mac and Windows; User friendly GUI; and Command line drivable. Major GUI features: Poydispersity and orientational distributions can be applied to most shape models except custom ones - Current options include: rectangular, Gaussian, Shulz, log normal and array (an array distribution will take any 2 column ASCII data file and apply it as a custom distribution); Instrument smearing options include none, Guassian on each point read from data, custom pinhole and custom slit; Fit weighting options include none, intensity error bar read from the data, and the square root of the intensity; Complex constrained fitting (including simultaneous constrained fits); Circular, annulus, sector, boxQx, boxQy, and boxsum 2D cuts of data available; A simple and advanced custom model built-in editor simplifies the creation of new models.

				 <h3>History</h3>

				 <p>SasView is the direct descendent of SansView.  SansView was the flagship application developed under the auspices of the NSF funded DANSE (Distributed Analysis for Neutron Scattering Experiments) project led out of Caltech.The Small Angle Neutron Scattering (SANS) portion of that project was led by The chemistry department at The University of Tennessee which continues to host some servers. SasView retains the version numbering sequence with SansView 2.1.1 being followed by the initial launch of SasView at version 2.2.  The five year Danse Project began in May 2006.  The final SANS flagship application, SansView, incoporated the lessons learned and feedback received from the community from its protype applications, particularly SliceView and PrView.  More information on the DANSE project can be found at <a href="http://danse.us" onMouseOver="window.status='danse website'; return true" onMouseOut="window.status=' '">danse.us</a> while the SANS portion of the project can be viewed at <a href="http://danse.chem.utk.edu" onMouseOver="window.status='SansView website'; return true" onMouseOut="window.status=' '">danse.chem.utk.edu</a>.</p>

				 <h3>Current Status</h3>
  
				<p>The NSF project officially ended on November 30, 2011.  From Dec 1, 2011 to April 2013, NIST, in co-operatoin with UMD, funded a full time developer in order to bridge the transition to a collaborative community project.  In the summer of 2012 both ISIS and ILL contributed a summer intern to work on the project and contributed some new models and improvements to the plotting and model selection mechanisms.  With this release we have moved to a new project with a more appropriate name, and have built a significant amount of the infrastructure to support a professional development activity including aquiring an appropriate domain name. Going forward we need to rapidly build up the expertise at the various facilities through workshops and meetings, and  start to build the infrastructure that engages the community at all levels.  Some possible development activities with high impact potential include a number of relatively common tasks that could benefit from buidling simplified user interfaces to the computational code, more improvements to the graphics output, improvement to the experiment saving functions and/or history, some code refactoring, and porting at least some of the fundtionality to a web interface. Of course user documentation while substantial could always benifit from more attention.  The current NIST project is to include a first set of tools for analysis of magnetic scattering.  magnetic contrast terms with any configuration of polarization on icoming and scattered beams for spheres, cylinders, and parallelopiped are planned in the first iteration</p>

<p>As we mover forward in transitioning to a facility stewardship model we hope to eventually expand the development to actively include the broader SAS user community.  In that vein, feel free to view <a href="https://sourceforge.net/apps/trac/sansviewproject/report/9">a current list of features</a> being discussed. Note that the renaming to SasView is not entirely complete ant the above list is still on the old SansView Project site.  This will eventually also move. If you feel you would like to contribute in any way, we would definitely like to hear from you - so please contact any of the management team.</p>
