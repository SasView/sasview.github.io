**Definition**

The scattering intensity $I(q)$ is calculated as

.. math::

    I(q) = \begin{cases}
    A q^{-m1} + \text{background} & q <= q_c \\
    C q^{-m2} + \text{background} & q > q_c
    \end{cases}

where $q_c$ = the location of the crossover from one slope to the other,
$A$ = the scaling coefficent that sets the overall intensity of the lower Q
power law region, $m1$ = power law exponent at low Q, and $m2$ = power law
exponent at high Q.  The scaling of the second power law region (coefficent C)
is then automatically scaled to match the first by following formula:

.. math::
    C = \frac{A q_c^{m2}}{q_c^{m1}}

.. note::
    Be sure to enter the power law exponents as positive values!

For 2D data the scattering intensity is calculated in the same way as 1D,
where the $q$ vector is defined as

.. math::

    q = \sqrt{q_x^2 + q_y^2}
