**Definition**

This model provides the form factor, $P(q)$, for stacked discs (tactoids)
with a core/layer structure which is constructed itself as $P(q) S(Q)$
multiplying a $P(q)$ for individual core/layer disks by a structure factor
$S(q)$ proposed by Kratky and Porod in 1949\ [#CIT1949]_ assuming the next
neighbor distance (d-spacing) in the stack of parallel discs obeys a Gaussian
distribution. As such the normalization of this "composite" form factor is
relative to the individual disk volume, not the volume of the stack of disks.
This model is appropriate for example for non non exfoliated clay particles such
as Laponite.

   Geometry of a single core/layer disk

The scattered intensity $I(q)$ is calculated as

.. math::

    I(q) = N\int_{0}^{\pi /2}\left[ \Delta \rho_t
    \left( V_t f_t(q,\alpha) - V_c f_c(q,\alpha)\right) + \Delta
    \rho_c V_c f_c(q,\alpha)\right]^2 S(q,\alpha)\sin{\alpha}\ d\alpha
    + \text{background}

where the contrast

.. math::

    \Delta \rho_i = \rho_i - \rho_\text{solvent}

and $N$ is the number of individual (single) discs per unit volume, $\alpha$ is
the angle between the axis of the disc and $q$, and $V_t$ and $V_c$ are the
total volume and the core volume of a single disc, respectively, and

.. math::

    f_t(q,\alpha) =
    \left(\frac{\sin(q(d+h)\cos{\alpha})}{q(d+h)\cos{\alpha}}\right)
    \left(\frac{2J_1(qR\sin{\alpha})}{qR\sin{\alpha}} \right)

    f_c(q,\alpha) =
    \left(\frac{\sin(qh)\cos{\alpha})}{qh\cos{\alpha}}\right)
    \left(\frac{2J_1(qR\sin{\alpha})}{qR\sin{\alpha}}\right)

where $d$ = thickness of the layer (*thick_layer*),
$2h$ = core thickness (*thick_core*), and $R$ = radius of the disc (*radius*).

.. math::

    S(q,\alpha) = 1 + \frac{1}{2}\sum_{k=1}^n(n-k)\cos{(kDq\cos{\alpha})}
    \exp\left[ -k(q)^2(D\cos{\alpha}~\sigma_d)^2/2\right]

where $n$ is the total number of the disc stacked (*n_stacking*),
$D = 2(d+h)$ is the next neighbor center-to-center distance (d-spacing),
and $\sigma_d$ = the Gaussian standard deviation of the d-spacing (*sigma_d*).
Note that $D\cos(\alpha)$ is the component of $D$ parallel to $q$ and the last
term in the equation above is effectively a Debye-Waller factor term. 

.. note::

    1. Each assembly in the stack is layer/core/layer, so the spacing of the
    cores is core plus two layers. The 2nd virial coefficient of the cylinder
    is calculated based on the *radius* and *length*
    = *n_stacking* * (*thick_core* + 2 * *thick_layer*)
    values, and used as the effective radius for $S(Q)$ when $P(Q) * S(Q)$
    is applied.

    2. the resolution smearing calculation uses 76 Gaussian quadrature points
    to properly smear the model since the function is HIGHLY oscillatory,
    especially around the q-values that correspond to the repeat distance of
    the layers.

To provide easy access to the orientation of the stacked disks, we define
the axis of the cylinder using two angles $\theta$ and $\varphi$.

Our model is derived from the form factor calculations implemented in a
c-library provided by the NIST Center for Neutron Research\ [#CIT_Kline]_
