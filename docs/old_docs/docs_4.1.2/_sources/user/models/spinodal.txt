**Definition**

This model calculates the SAS signal of a phase separating solution under spinodal decomposition. 
The scattering intensity $I(q)$ is calculated as

.. math:: 
    I(q) = I_{max}\frac{(1+\gamma/2)x^2}{\gamma/2+x^{2+\gamma}}+B

where $x=q/q_0$ and $B$ is a flat background. The characteristic structure length 
scales with the correlation peak at $q_0$. The exponent $\gamma$ is equal to 
$d+1$ with d the dimensionality of the off-critical concentration mixtures.
A transition to $\gamma=2d$ is seen near the percolation threshold into the 
critical concentration regime.
