**Definitions**

Calculates the scattering from a cylinder with spherical section end-caps.
Like :ref:`barbell`, this is a sphereocylinder with end caps that have a
radius larger than that of the cylinder, but with the center of the end cap
radius lying within the cylinder. This model simply becomes a convex
lens when the length of the cylinder $L=0$. See the diagram for the details
of the geometry and restrictions on parameter values.

.. figure:: img/capped_cylinder_geometry.jpg

    Capped cylinder geometry, where $r$ is *radius*, $R$ is *bell_radius* and
    $L$ is *length*. Since the end cap radius $R \geq r$ and by definition
    for this geometry $h < 0$, $h$ is then defined by $r$ and $R$ as
    $h = - \sqrt{R^2 - r^2}$

The scattered intensity $I(q)$ is calculated as

.. math::

    I(q) = \frac{\Delta \rho^2}{V} \left<A^2(q,\alpha).sin(\alpha)\right>

where the amplitude $A(q,\alpha)$ with the rod axis at angle $\alpha$ to $q$ is given as

.. math::

    A(q) =&\ \pi r^2L
        \frac{\sin\left(\tfrac12 qL\cos\alpha\right)}
            {\tfrac12 qL\cos\alpha}
        \frac{2 J_1(qr\sin\alpha)}{qr\sin\alpha} \\
        &\ + 4 \pi R^3 \int_{-h/R}^1 dt
        \cos\left[ q\cos\alpha
            \left(Rt + h + {\tfrac12} L\right)\right]
        \times (1-t^2)
        \frac{J_1\left[qR\sin\alpha \left(1-t^2\right)^{1/2}\right]}
             {qR\sin\alpha \left(1-t^2\right)^{1/2}}

The $\left<\ldots\right>$ brackets denote an average of the structure over
all orientations. $\left< A^2(q)\right>$ is then the form factor, $P(q)$.
The scale factor is equivalent to the volume fraction of cylinders, each of
volume, $V$. Contrast $\Delta\rho$ is the difference of scattering length
densities of the cylinder and the surrounding solvent.

The volume of the capped cylinder is (with $h$ as a positive value here)

.. math::

    V = \pi r_c^2 L + \tfrac{2\pi}{3}(R-h)^2(2R + h)


and its radius of gyration is

.. math::

    R_g^2 =&\ \left[ \tfrac{12}{5}R^5
        + R^4\left(6h+\tfrac32 L\right)
        + R^2\left(4h^2 + L^2 + 4Lh\right)
        + R^2\left(3Lh^2 + \tfrac32 L^2h\right) \right. \\
        &\ \left. + \tfrac25 h^5 - \tfrac12 Lh^4 - \tfrac12 L^2h^3
        + \tfrac14 L^3r^2 + \tfrac32 Lr^4 \right]
        \left( 4R^3 6R^2h - 2h^3 + 3r^2L \right)^{-1}


.. note::

    The requirement that $R \geq r$ is not enforced in the model!
    It is up to you to restrict this during analysis.

The 2D scattering intensity is calculated similar to the 2D cylinder model.
