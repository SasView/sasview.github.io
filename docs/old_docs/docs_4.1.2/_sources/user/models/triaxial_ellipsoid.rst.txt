The returned value is scaled to units of |cm^-1| |sr^-1|, absolute scale.


All three axes are of different lengths with $R_a \leq R_b \leq R_c$
**Users should maintain this inequality for all calculations**.

.. math::

    P(q) = \text{scale} V \left< F^2(q) \right> + \text{background}

where the volume $V = 4/3 \pi R_a R_b R_c$, and the averaging
$\left<\ldots\right>$ is applied over all orientations for 1D.

**Definition**

The form factor calculated is

.. math::

    P(q) = \frac{\text{scale}}{V}\int_0^1\int_0^1
        \Phi^2(qR_a^2\cos^2( \pi x/2) + qR_b^2\sin^2(\pi y/2)(1-y^2) + R_c^2y^2)
        dx dy

where

.. math::

    \Phi(u) = 3 u^{-3} (\sin u - u \cos u)

To provide easy access to the orientation of the triaxial ellipsoid,
we define the axis of the cylinder using the angles $\theta$, $\phi$
and $\psi$. These angles are defined on
:numref:`triaxial-ellipsoid-angles`.
The angle $\psi$ is the rotational angle around its own $c$ axis
against the $q$ plane. For example, $\psi = 0$ when the
$a$ axis is parallel to the $x$ axis of the detector.

    The angles for oriented ellipsoid.

The radius-of-gyration for this system is  $R_g^2 = (R_a R_b R_c)^2/5$.

The contrast is defined as SLD(ellipsoid) - SLD(solvent).  In the
parameters, $R_a$ is the minor equatorial radius, $R_b$ is the major
equatorial radius, and $R_c$ is the polar radius of the ellipsoid.

NB: The 2nd virial coefficient of the triaxial solid ellipsoid is
calculated based on the polar radius $R_p = R_c$ and equatorial
radius $R_e = \sqrt{R_a R_b}$, and used as the effective radius for
$S(q)$ when $P(q) \cdot S(q)$ is applied.

**Validation**

Validation of our code was done by comparing the output of the
1D calculation to the angular average of the output of 2D calculation
over all possible angles.
