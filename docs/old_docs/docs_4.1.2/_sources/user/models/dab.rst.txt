Calculates the scattering from a randomly distributed, two-phase system based on
the Debye-Anderson-Brumberger (DAB) model for such systems. The two-phase system
is characterized by a single length scale, the correlation length, which is a
measure of the average spacing between regions of phase 1 and phase 2. **The
model also assumes smooth interfaces between the phases** and hence exhibits
Porod behavior $(I \sim q^{-4})$ at large $q$, $(qL \gg 1)$.

The DAB model is ostensibly a development of the earlier Debye-Bueche model.

**Definition**

.. math::

    I(q) = \text{scale}\cdot\frac{L^3}{(1 + (q\cdot L)^2)^2} + \text{background}

where scale is

.. math:: \text{scale} = 8 \pi \phi (1-\phi) \Delta\rho^2

and the parameter $L$ is the correlation length.

For 2D data the scattering intensity is calculated in the same way as 1D,
where the $q$ vector is defined as

.. math:: q = \sqrt{q_x^2 + q_y^2}
