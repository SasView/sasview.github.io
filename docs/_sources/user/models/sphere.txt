**Definition**

The 1D scattering intensity is calculated in the following way (Guinier, 1955)

.. math::

    I(q) = \frac{\text{scale}}{V} \cdot \left[
        3V(\Delta\rho) \cdot \frac{\sin(qr) - qr\cos(qr))}{(qr)^3}
        \right]^2 + \text{background}

where *scale* is a volume fraction, $V$ is the volume of the scatterer,
$r$ is the radius of the sphere and *background* is the background level.
*sld* and *sld_solvent* are the scattering length densities (SLDs) of the
scatterer and the solvent respectively, whose difference is $\Delta\rho$.

Note that if your data is in absolute scale, the *scale* should represent
the volume fraction (which is unitless) if you have a good fit. If not,
it should represent the volume fraction times a factor (by which your data
might need to be rescaled).

The 2D scattering intensity is the same as above, regardless of the
orientation of $\vec q$.

**Validation**

Validation of our code was done by comparing the output of the 1D model
to the output of the software provided by the NIST (Kline, 2006).
