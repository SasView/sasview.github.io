**Definition**
Calculates the scattering from a fractal structure with a primary building
block of core-shell spheres, as opposed to just homogeneous spheres in
the fractal model. It is an extension of the well known Teixeira\ [#teixeira]_
fractal model replacing the $P(q)$ of a solid sphere with that of a core-shell
sphere. This model could find use for aggregates of coated particles, or
aggregates of vesicles for example.

.. math::

    I(q) = P(q)S(q) + \text{background}

Where $P(q)$ is the core-shell form factor and $S(q)$ is the
Teixeira\ [#teixeira]_ fractal structure factor both of which are given again
below:

.. math::

    P(q) &= \frac{\phi}{V_s}\left[3V_c(\rho_c-\rho_s)
    \frac{\sin(qr_c)-qr_c\cos(qr_c)}{(qr_c)^3}+
    3V_s(\rho_s-\rho_{solv})
    \frac{\sin(qr_s)-qr_s\cos(qr_s)}{(qr_s)^3}\right]^2 \\
    S(q) &= 1 + \frac{D_f\ \Gamma\!(D_f-1)}{[1+1/(q\xi)^2]^{(D_f-1)/2}}
    \frac{\sin[(D_f-1)\tan^{-1}(q\xi)]}{(qr_s)^{D_f}}

where $\phi$ is the volume fraction of particles, $V_s$ is the volume of the
whole particle, $V_c$ is the volume of the core, $\rho_c$, $\rho_s$, and
$\rho_{solv}$ are the scattering length densities of the core, shell, and
solvent respectively, $r_c$ and $r_s$ are the radius of the core and the radius
of the whole particle respectively, $D_f$ is the fractal dimension, and $\xi$ the
correlation length.

Polydispersity of radius and thickness are also provided for.

This model does not allow for anisotropy and thus the 2D scattering intensity
is calculated in the same way as 1D, where the $q$ vector is defined as

.. math::

    q = \sqrt{q_x^2 + q_y^2}

Our model is derived from the form factor calculations implemented in IGOR
macros by the NIST Center for Neutron Research\ [#Kline]_
