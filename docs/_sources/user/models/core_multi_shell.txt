=======================================================

This model provides the scattering from a spherical core with 1 to 4  concentric shell structures. The SLDs of the core and each shell are  individually specified.

**Definition**

This model is a trivial extension of the CoreShell function to a larger number
of shells. The scattering length density profile for the default sld values
(w/ 4 shells).

.. figure:: img/core_multi_shell_sld_default_profile.jpg

    SLD profile of the core_multi_shell object from the center of sphere out
    for the default SLDs.*

The 2D scattering intensity is the same as $P(q)$ above, regardless of the
orientation of the $\vec q$ vector which is defined as

.. math::

    q = \sqrt{q_x^2 + q_y^2}

.. note:: **Be careful!** The SLDs and scale can be highly correlated. Hold as
         many of these parameters fixed as possible.

.. note:: The outer most radius (= *radius* + *thickness*) is used as the
          effective radius for $S(Q)$ when $P(Q)*S(Q)$ is applied.

For information about polarised and magnetic scattering, see
the :ref:`magnetism` documentation.

Our model uses the form factor calculations implemented in a c-library provided
by the NIST Center for Neutron Research (Kline, 2006) [#kline]_.
