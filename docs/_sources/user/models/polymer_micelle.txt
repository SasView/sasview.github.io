This model provides the form factor, $P(q)$, for a micelle with a spherical
core and Gaussian polymer chains attached to the surface, thus may be applied
to block copolymer micelles. To work well the Gaussian chains must be much
smaller than the core, which is often not the case.  Please study the
reference carefully.

**Definition**

The 1D scattering intensity for this model is calculated according to
the equations given by Pedersen (Pedersen, 2000), summarised briefly here.

The micelle core is imagined as $N\_aggreg$ polymer heads, each of volume $v\_core$,
which then defines a micelle core of $radius\_core$, which is a separate parameter
even though it could be directly determined.
The Gaussian random coil tails, of gyration radius $rg$, are imagined uniformly 
distributed around the spherical core, centred at a distance $radius\_core + d\_penetration.rg$
from the micelle centre, where $d\_penetration$ is of order unity.
A volume $v\_corona$ is defined for each coil.
The model in detail seems to separately parametrise the terms for the shape of I(Q) and the
relative intensity of each term, so use with caution and check parameters for consistency.
The spherical core is monodisperse, so it's intensity and the cross terms may have sharp
oscillations (use q resolution smearing if needs be to help remove them).

.. math::
    P(q) = N^2\beta^2_s\Phi(qR)^2+N\beta^2_cP_c(q)+2N^2\beta_s\beta_cS_{sc}s_c(q)+N(N-1)\beta_c^2S_{cc}(q)
    
    \beta_s = v\_core(sld\_core - sld\_solvent)
    
    \beta_c = v\_corona(sld\_corona - sld\_solvent)

where $N = n\_aggreg$, and for the spherical core of radius $R$ 

.. math::   
   \Phi(qR)= \frac{\sin(qr) - qr\cos(qr)}{(qr)^3}

whilst for the Gaussian coils

.. math::

   P_c(q) &= 2 [\exp(-Z) + Z - 1] / Z^2

   Z &= (q R_g)^2

The sphere to coil ( core to corona) and coil to coil (corona to corona) cross terms are
approximated by:

.. math::
   
   S_{sc}(q)=\Phi(qR)\psi(Z)\frac{sin(q(R+d.R_g))}{q(R+d.R_g)}
   
   S_{cc}(q)=\psi(Z)^2\left[\frac{sin(q(R+d.R_g))}{q(R+d.R_g)} \right ]^2
   
   \psi(Z)=\frac{[1-exp^{-Z}]}{Z}

**Validation**

$P(q)$ above is multiplied by $ndensity$, and a units conversion of 10^{-13}, so $scale$
is likely 1.0 if the scattering data is in absolute units. This model has not yet been 
independently validated.
