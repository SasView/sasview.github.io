**Definition**

This model calculates an empirical functional form for SAS data characterized
by a broad scattering peak. Many SAS spectra are characterized by a broad peak
even though they are from amorphous soft materials. For example, soft systems
that show a SAS peak include copolymers, polyelectrolytes, multiphase systems,
layered structures, etc.

The d-spacing corresponding to the broad peak is a characteristic distance
between the scattering inhomogeneities (such as in lamellar, cylindrical, or
spherical morphologies, or for bicontinuous structures).

The scattering intensity $I(q)$ is calculated as

.. math:: I(q) = \frac{A}{q^n} + \frac{C}{1 + (|q - q_0|\xi)^m} + B

Here the peak position is related to the d-spacing as $q_0 = 2\pi / d_0$.

$A$ is the Porod law scale factor, $n$ the Porod exponent, $C$ is the
Lorentzian scale factor, $m$ the exponent of $q$, $\xi$ the screening length,
and $B$ the flat background.

For 2D data the scattering intensity is calculated in the same way as 1D,
where the $q$ vector is defined as

.. math:: q = \sqrt{q_x^2 + q_y^2}
