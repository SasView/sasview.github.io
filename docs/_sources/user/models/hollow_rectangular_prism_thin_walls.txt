**Definition**


This model provides the form factor, $P(q)$, for a hollow rectangular
prism with infinitely thin walls. It computes only the 1D scattering, not the 2D.
The 1D scattering intensity for this model is calculated according to the
equations given by Nayuk and Huber\ [#Nayuk2012]_.

Assuming a hollow parallelepiped with infinitely thin walls, edge lengths
$A \le B \le C$ and presenting an orientation with respect to the
scattering vector given by $\theta$ and $\phi$, where $\theta$ is the angle
between the $z$ axis and the longest axis of the parallelepiped $C$, and
$\phi$ is the angle between the scattering vector (lying in the $xy$ plane)
and the $y$ axis, the form factor is given by

.. math::

    P(q) = \frac{1}{V^2} \frac{2}{\pi} \int_0^{\frac{\pi}{2}}
           \int_0^{\frac{\pi}{2}} [A_L(q)+A_T(q)]^2 \sin\theta\,d\theta\,d\phi

where

.. math::

    V &= 2AB + 2AC + 2BC \\
    A_L(q) &=  8 \times \frac{
            \sin \left( \tfrac{1}{2} q A \sin\phi \sin\theta \right)
            \sin \left( \tfrac{1}{2} q B \cos\phi \sin\theta \right)
            \cos \left( \tfrac{1}{2} q C \cos\theta \right)
        }{q^2 \, \sin^2\theta \, \sin\phi \cos\phi} \\
    A_T(q) &=  A_F(q) \times
      \frac{2\,\sin \left( \tfrac{1}{2} q C \cos\theta \right)}{q\,\cos\theta}

and

.. math::

  A_F(q) =  4 \frac{ \cos \left( \tfrac{1}{2} q A \sin\phi \sin\theta \right)
                       \sin \left( \tfrac{1}{2} q B \cos\phi \sin\theta \right) }
                     {q \, \cos\phi \, \sin\theta} +
              4 \frac{ \sin \left( \tfrac{1}{2} q A \sin\phi \sin\theta \right)
                       \cos \left( \tfrac{1}{2} q B \cos\phi \sin\theta \right) }
                     {q \, \sin\phi \, \sin\theta}

The 1D scattering intensity is then calculated as

.. math::

  I(q) = \text{scale} \times V \times (\rho_\text{p} - \rho_\text{solvent})^2 \times P(q)

where $V$ is the surface area of the rectangular prism, $\rho_\text{p}$
is the scattering length density of the parallelepiped, $\rho_\text{solvent}$
is the scattering length density of the solvent, and (if the data are in
absolute units) *scale* is related to the total surface area.

**The 2D scattering intensity is not computed by this model.**


**Validation**

Validation of the code was conducted  by qualitatively comparing the output
of the 1D model to the curves shown in (Nayuk, 2012\ [#Nayuk2012]_).
