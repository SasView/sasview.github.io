**Definition**

This model is a trivial extension of the core_shell_sphere function where the
core is filled with solvent and is surrounded by $N$ shells of material
(such as lipids) interleaved with $N - 1$ layers of solvent. For $N = 1$, this
returns the same as the vesicle model, except for the normalisation, which here
is to outermost volume. The shell thicknesses and SLD are constant for all
shells as expected for a multilayer vesicle.

    Geometry of the multilayer_vesicle model.

See the :ref:`core-shell-sphere` model for more documentation.

The 1D scattering intensity is calculated in the following way (Guinier, 1955)

.. math::
    P(q) = \text{scale} \cdot \frac{\phi}{V(R_N)} F^2(q) + \text{background}

where

.. math::
     F(q) = (\rho_\text{shell}-\rho_\text{solv}) \sum_{i=1}^{N} \left[
     3V(r_i)\frac{\sin(qr_i) - qr_i\cos(qr_i)}{(qr_i)^3}
     - 3V(R_i)\frac{\sin(qR_i) - qR_i\cos(qR_i)}{(qR_i)^3}
     \right]

for

.. math::

     r_i &= r_c + (i-1)(t_s + t_w) && \text{ solvent radius before shell } i \\
     R_i &= r_i + t_s && \text{ shell radius for shell } i

$\phi$ is the volume fraction of particles, $V(r)$ is the volume of a sphere
of radius $r$, $r_c$ is the radius of the core, $t_s$ is the thickness of
the shell, $t_w$ is the thickness of the solvent layer between the shells,
$\rho_\text{shell}$ is the scattering length density of a shell, and
$\rho_\text{solv}$ is the scattering length density of the solvent.

USAGE NOTES

* The outer-most shell radius $R_N$ is used as the effective radius
  for $P(Q)$ when $P(Q) * S(Q)$ is applied.
  calculations rather slow.
* The number of shells is always rounded to an integer value as a non interger
  number of layers is not physical.
* Thus Polydispersity should only be applied to number of shells **VERY
  CAREFULLY**.  A possible legitimate use would be for mixed systems in which
  some vesicles have 1 shell, some have 2, etc. A polydispersity on $N$ can be
  used to model the data by using the "array distriubtion" feature. First
  create a file such as *shell_dist.txt* containing the relative portion
  of each vesicle size::

    1 20
    2  4
    3  1

  Turn on polydispersity and select an array distribution for the *n_shells*
  parameter.  Choose the above *shell_dist.txt* file, and the model will be
  computed with 80% 1-shell vesicles, 16% 2-shell vesicles and 4%
  3-shell vesicles.
* This is a highly non-linear, highly oscillatory (especially around the
  q-values that correspond to the repeat distance of the layers), model
  function complicated by the fact that the number of water/shell pairs must
  physically be an integer value, although the optimization treats it as a
  floating point value. Thus it may be that the resolution interpolation is not
  sufficiently fine grained in certain cases. Please report any such occurences
  to the SasView team. Generally, for the best possible experience:
 * Start with the best possible guess
 * Using a priori knowledge, hold as many parameters fixed as possible
 * if N=1, tw (water thickness) must by definition be zero. Both N and tw should
   be fixed during fitting.
 * If N>1, use constraints to keep N > 1
 * Because N only really moves in integer steps, it may get "stuck" if the
   optimizer step size is too small so care should be taken
   If you experience problems with this please contact the SasView team and let
   them know the issue preferably with example data and model which fail to
   converge.

The 2D scattering intensity is the same as 1D, regardless of the orientation
of the q vector which is defined as:

.. math::

    q = \sqrt{q_x^2 + q_y^2}
