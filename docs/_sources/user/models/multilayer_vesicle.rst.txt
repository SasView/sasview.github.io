**Definition**

This model is a trivial extension of the core_shell_sphere function to include
*N* shells where the core is filled with solvent and the shells are interleaved
with layers of solvent. For *N = 1*, this returns the same as the vesicle model.
The shell thicknessess and SLD are constant across all shells as expected for
a multilayer vesicle.

    Geometry of the multilayer_vesicle model.

See the :ref:`core-shell-sphere` model for more documentation.

The 2D scattering intensity is the same as 1D, regardless of the orientation
of the q vector which is defined as:

.. math::

    q = \sqrt{q_x^2 + q_y^2}

.. note:
    The outer most radius
    $radius + n_pairs * thicn_shell + (n_pairs - 1) * thick_solvent$
    is used as the effective radius for *S(Q)* when $P(Q) * S(Q)$ is applied.

For information about polarised and magnetic scattering, see
the :ref:`magnetism` documentation.

This code is based on the form factor calculations implemented in the NIST
Center for Neutron Research provided c-library (Kline, 2006).
