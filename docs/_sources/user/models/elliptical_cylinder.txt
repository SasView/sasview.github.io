   Elliptical cylinder geometry $a = r_\text{minor}$
   and $\nu = r_\text{major} / r_\text{minor}$ is the *axis_ratio*.

The function calculated is

.. math::

    I(\vec q)=\frac{1}{V_\text{cyl}}\int{d\psi}\int{d\phi}\int{
        p(\theta,\phi,\psi)F^2(\vec q,\alpha,\psi)\sin(\alpha)d\alpha}

with the functions

.. math::

    F(q,\alpha,\psi) = 2\frac{J_1(a)\sin(b)}{ab}

where

.. math::

    a = qr'\sin(\alpha)

    b = q\frac{L}{2}\cos(\alpha)

    r'=\frac{r_{minor}}{\sqrt{2}}\sqrt{(1+\nu^{2}) + (1-\nu^{2})cos(\psi)}


and the angle $\psi$ is defined as the orientation of the major axis of the
ellipse with respect to the vector $\vec q$. The angle $\alpha$ is the angle
between the axis of the cylinder and $\vec q$.


For 1D scattering, with no preferred orientation, the form factor is averaged over all possible orientations and normalized
by the particle volume

.. math::

    P(q) = \text{scale}  <F^2> / V

For 2d data the orientation of the particle is required, described using a different set
of angles as in the diagrams below, for further details of the calculation and angular
dispersions  see :ref:`orientation` .

    Note that the angles here are not the same as in the equations for the scattering function.
    Rotation $\theta$, initially in the $xz$ plane, is carried out first, then
    rotation $\phi$ about the $z$ axis, finally rotation $\Psi$ is now around the axis of the cylinder.
    The neutron or X-ray beam is along the $z$ axis.

    Examples of the angles for oriented elliptical cylinders against the
    detector plane, with $\Psi$ = 0.

The $\theta$ and $\phi$ parameters to orient the cylinder only appear in the model when fitting 2d data.


NB: The 2nd virial coefficient of the cylinder is calculated based on the
averaged radius $(=\sqrt{r_\text{minor}^2 * \text{axis ratio}})$ and length
values, and used as the effective radius for $S(Q)$ when $P(Q)*S(Q)$ is applied.


**Validation**

Validation of our code was done by comparing the output of the 1D calculation
to the angular average of the output of the 2D calculation over all possible
angles.

In the 2D average, more binning in the angle $\phi$ is necessary to get the
proper result. The following figure shows the results of the averaging by
varying the number of angular bins.
