This model calculates the scattering from a gel structure,
but typically a physical rather than chemical network.
It is modeled as a sum of a low-q exponential decay (which happens to
give a functional form similar to Guinier scattering, so interpret with
care) plus a Lorentzian at higher-q values. See also the gel_fit model.

**Definition**

The scattering intensity $I(q)$ is calculated as (Eqn. 5 from the reference)

.. math:: I(q) = I_G(0) \exp(-q^2\Xi ^2/2) + I_L(0)/(1+q^2\xi^2)

$\Xi$ is the length scale of the static correlations in the gel, which can
be attributed to the "frozen-in" crosslinks. $\xi$ is the dynamic correlation
length, which can be attributed to the fluctuating polymer chains between
crosslinks. $I_G(0)$ and $I_L(0)$ are the scaling factors for each of these
structures. Think carefully about how these map to your particular system!

.. note::
    The peaked structure at higher $q$ values (Figure 2 from the reference)
    is not reproduced by the model. Peaks can be introduced into the model
    by summing this model with the :ref:`gaussian-peak` model.

For 2D data the scattering intensity is calculated in the same way as 1D,
where the $q$ vector is defined as

.. math:: q = \sqrt{q_x^2 + q_y^2}
