**Definition**

Parameters for this model are the core axial ratio X and a shell thickness,
which are more often what we would like to determine and makes the model
better behaved, particularly when polydispersity is applied than the four
independent radii used in the original parameterization of this model.

The geometric parameters of this model are

*radius_equat_core =* equatorial core radius *= Rminor_core*

*X_core = polar_core / radius_equat_core = Rmajor_core / Rminor_core*

*Thick_shell = equat_outer - radius_equat_core = Rminor_outer - Rminor_core*

*XpolarShell = Tpolar_shell / Thick_shell = (Rmajor_outer - Rmajor_core)/
(Rminor_outer - Rminor_core)*

In terms of the original radii

*polar_core = radius_equat_core * X_core*

*equat_shell = radius_equat_core + Thick_shell*

*polar_shell = radius_equat_core * X_core + Thick_shell * XpolarShell*

(where we note that "shell" perhaps confusingly, relates to the outer radius)
When *X_core < 1* the core is oblate; when *X_core > 1* it is prolate.
*X_core = 1* is a spherical core.

For a fixed shell thickness *XpolarShell = 1*, to scale the shell thickness
pro-rata with the radius *XpolarShell = X_core*.

When including an $S(q)$, the radius in $S(q)$ is calculated to be that of
a sphere with the same 2nd virial coefficient of the outer surface of the
ellipsoid. This may have some undesirable effects if the aspect ratio of the
ellipsoid is large (ie, if $X << 1$ or $X >> 1$ ), when the $S(q)$
- which assumes spheres - will not in any case be valid.

If SAS data are in absolute units, and the SLDs are correct, then scale should
be the total volume fraction of the "outer particle". When $S(q)$ is introduced
this moves to the $S(q)$ volume fraction, and scale should then be 1.0,
or contain some other units conversion factor (for example, if you have SAXS data).
