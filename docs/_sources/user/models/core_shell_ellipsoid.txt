**Definition**

Parameters for this model are the core axial ratio X and a shell thickness,
which are more often what we would like to determine and makes the model
better behaved, particularly when polydispersity is applied than the four
independent radii used in the original parameterization of this model.

The geometric parameters of this model are shown in the diagram above, which
shows (a) a cut through at the circular equator and (b) a cross section through
the poles, of a prolate ellipsoid.

When *X_core < 1* the core is oblate; when *X_core > 1* it is prolate.
*X_core = 1* is a spherical core.

For a fixed shell thickness *XpolarShell = 1*, to scale the shell thickness
pro-rata with the radius set or constrain *XpolarShell = X_core*.

When including an $S(q)$, the radius in $S(q)$ is calculated to be that of
a sphere with the same 2nd virial coefficient of the outer surface of the
ellipsoid. This may have some undesirable effects if the aspect ratio of the
ellipsoid is large (ie, if $X << 1$ or $X >> 1$ ), when the $S(q)$
- which assumes spheres - will not in any case be valid.  Generating a
custom product model will enable separate effective volume fraction and
effective radius in the $S(q)$.

If SAS data are in absolute units, and the SLDs are correct, then scale should
be the total volume fraction of the "outer particle". When $S(q)$ is introduced
this moves to the $S(q)$ volume fraction, and scale should then be 1.0, or
contain some other units conversion factor (for example, if you have SAXS data).

The calculation of intensity follows that for the solid ellipsoid, but
with separate terms for the core-shell and shell-solvent boundaries.

.. math::

    P(q,\alpha) = \frac{\text{scale}}{V} F^2(q,\alpha) + \text{background}

where

.. math::
    :nowrap:

    \begin{align*}
    F(q,\alpha) = &f(q,radius\_equat\_core,radius\_equat\_core.x\_core,\alpha) \\
    &+ f(q,radius\_equat\_core + thick\_shell,
         radius\_equat\_core.x\_core + thick\_shell.x\_polar\_shell,\alpha)
    \end{align*}

where

.. math::

    f(q,R_e,R_p,\alpha) = \frac{3 \Delta \rho V (\sin[qr(R_p,R_e,\alpha)]
                - \cos[qr(R_p,R_e,\alpha)])}
                {[qr(R_p,R_e,\alpha)]^3}

and

.. math::

    r(R_e,R_p,\alpha) = \left[ R_e^2 \sin^2 \alpha
        + R_p^2 \cos^2 \alpha \right]^{1/2}


$\alpha$ is the angle between the axis of the ellipsoid and $\vec q$,
$V = (4/3)\pi R_pR_e^2$ is the volume of the ellipsoid , $R_p$ is the
polar radius along the rotational axis of the ellipsoid, $R_e$ is the
equatorial radius perpendicular to the rotational axis of the ellipsoid
and $\Delta \rho$ (contrast) is the scattering length density difference,
either $(sld\_core - sld\_shell)$ or $(sld\_shell - sld\_solvent)$.

For randomly oriented particles:

.. math::

   F^2(q)=\int_{0}^{\pi/2}{F^2(q,\alpha)\sin(\alpha)d\alpha}

For oriented ellipsoids the *theta*, *phi* and *psi* orientation parameters
will appear when fitting 2D data, see the :ref:`elliptical-cylinder` model
for further information.
