Polydispersity in the bilayer thickness can be applied from the GUI.

**Definition**

The scattering intensity $I(q)$ for dilute, randomly oriented,
"infinitely large" sheets or lamellae is

.. math::

    I(q) = \text{scale}\frac{2\pi P(q)}{q^2\delta} + \text{background}


The form factor is

.. math::

   P(q) = \frac{2\Delta\rho^2}{q^2}(1-\cos(q\delta))
        = \frac{4\Delta\rho^2}{q^2}\sin^2\left(\frac{q\delta}{2}\right)

where $\delta$ is the total layer thickness and $\Delta\rho$ is the
scattering length density difference.

This is the limiting form for a spherical shell of infinitely large radius.
Note that the division by $\delta$ means that $scale$ in sasview is the
volume fraction of sheet, $\phi = S\delta$ where $S$ is the area of sheet
per unit volume. $S$ is half the Porod surface area per unit volume of a
thicker layer (as that would include both faces of the sheet).

The 2D scattering intensity is calculated in the same way as 1D, where
the $q$ vector is defined as

.. math::

    q = \sqrt{q_x^2 + q_y^2}
