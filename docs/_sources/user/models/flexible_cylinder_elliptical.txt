This model calculates the form factor for a flexible cylinder with an
elliptical cross section and a uniform scattering length density.
The non-negligible diameter of the cylinder is included by accounting
for excluded volume interactions within the walk of a single cylinder.
The form factor is normalized by the particle volume such that

.. math::

    P(q) = \text{scale} \left<F^2\right>/V + \text{background}

where the averaging $\left<\ldots\right>$ is over all possible orientations
of the flexible cylinder.

The 2D scattering intensity is the same as 1D, regardless of the orientation
of the q vector which is defined as

.. math::

    q = \sqrt{q_x^2 + q_y^2}


**Definitions**

The function calculated in a similar way to that for the flexible_cylinder model
from the reference given below using the author's "Method 3 With Excluded Volume".
The model is a parameterization of simulations of a discrete representation of
the worm-like chain model of Kratky and Porod applied in the pseudo-continuous
limit. See equations (13, 26-27) in the original reference for the details.

.. note::

    There are several typos in the original reference that have been corrected
    by WRC. Details of the corrections are in the reference below. Most notably

    - Equation (13): the term $(1 - w(QR))$ should swap position with $w(QR)$

    - Equations (23) and (24) are incorrect; WRC has entered these into
      Mathematica and solved analytically. The results were then converted to
      code.

    - Equation (27) should be $q0 = max(a3/sqrt(RgSquare),3)$ instead of
      $max(a3*b/sqrt(RgSquare),3)$

    - The scattering function is negative for a range of parameter values and
      q-values that are experimentally accessible. A correction function has been
      added to give the proper behavior.

The chain of contour length, $L$, (the total length) can be described as a chain
of some number of locally stiff segments of length $l_p$, the persistence length
(the length along the cylinder over which the flexible cylinder can be considered
a rigid rod).
The Kuhn length $(b = 2*l_p)$ is also used to describe the stiffness of a chain.

The cross section of the cylinder is elliptical, with minor radius $a$ .
The major radius is larger, so of course, **the axis ratio (parameter 5) must be
greater than one.** Simple constraints should be applied during curve fitting to
maintain this inequality.

The returned value is in units of $cm^{-1}$, on absolute scale.

In the parameters, the $sld$ and $sld\_solvent$ represent the SLD of the
chain/cylinder and solvent respectively. The *scale*, and the contrast are both
multiplicative factors in the model and are perfectly correlated. One or both of
these parameters must be held fixed during model fitting.

**No inter-cylinder interference effects are included in this calculation.**
