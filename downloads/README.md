# downloads
This folder is where files directly downloadable from the website live!

Files in here may, or may not, be the same as those in 
https://github.com/SasView/docs/tree/master/_downloads depending on how 
recently files were updated relative to a SasView release.

You can add/replace files in this folder to make them immediately available 
via the website, rather than having to wait for the new release cycle.

But on't forget to edit download.md in the folder above if you add a file!
