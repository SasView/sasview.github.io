                <h3>What's new in version 4.2 Beta</h3>
                <ul>
                    <li>This is a beta pre-release version of 4.2.0.</li>

					<li>Highlights are:</li>
					<ul>
					<li>The infrastucture for calculating 2D patterns from 3D orientated objects has now been totally refactored</li>
					<li>Plugins,including sum/multiply models, have completely migrated to the new infrastructure</li>
					<li>Some batch slicing options have been introduced</li>
					<li>The known issue with the core_shell_parallelepiped is now fixed</li>
					<li>There are several data loading improvements</li>
					<li>There are several save project improvements (with more to come)</li>
					<li>There have been numerous bug fixes</li>
					<li>There has been lots of documentation enhancement</li>
					<li>There are some new tutorials!</li>
					</ul>
                </ul>
                
                <h3>What's new in version 4.1.2</h3>
                <ul>
                    <li>This is a bug-fix release.</li>
                </ul>
                
                <h3>What's new in version 4.1.1</h3>
                <ul>
                    <li>This is a bug-fix release.</li>
                </ul>
                
                <h3>What's new in version 4.1</h3>
                <ul>
                    <li>This point release brings a series of new features and improvements, and a host of bug fixes. Of particular note are:</li>
                	<ul>
                	<li><b>SasView 4.1 will be the last version of SasView that will support native 32-bit operating systems.</b></li>
					</ul>
					<ul>
					<li>Correlation Function Analysis</li>
					<ul>
					<li>This performs a correlation function analysis of one-dimensional SAXS/SANS data using Adam Washington`s 
					CorfuncPy package. This essentially provides the capability of the old CCP13 <i>CORFUNC</i> package to the
					current generation of small-angle scatterers.</li>
					<li>A correlation function may be interpreted in terms of an imaginary rod of a given length moving through 
					the structure of the material under study. It is the probability that the rod will have equal 
					electron/neutron scattering length density at either end. Hence, repeatedly occurring regions of similar 
					density within the material will be manifested as a peak in the correlation function.</li>
					</ul>
					</ul>
					<ul>
					<li>Fitting of SESANS Data</li>
					<ul>
					<li>Data from Spin-Echo SANS measurements can now be loaded and fitted. The data will be plotted against the 
					correct axes and models will automatically perform a Hankel transform in order to calculate SESANS from a SANS 
					model.</li>
					</ul>
                	<li>A file converter tool for multi-file single-column data sets has been added (eg, BSL and some other SAXS 
                	instrument formats)</li>
                	</ul>
					<ul>
                	<li>The way that orientation (and thereby orientational distribution) is defined is being refactored to address 
                	long standing issues and user comments. <b>In this release, however, only models with symmetry (e.g. a=b) have 
                	been converted to the new definitions.</b> The rest (a <> b <> c - e.g. parellelepiped) maintain the same 
                	definition as in previous versions of SasView and will be converted in SasView 4.2. Please consult the help 
                	documentation to see which definition is being used for a given model.</li>
                	</ul>
                	<ul>
                	<li><b>SasView 4.1 will probably be the last version to support user plug-in models written for SasView versions 3.x 
                	and earlier.</b> Any such models should be re-written or converted to the new plug-in model architecture. Please consult 
                	the help documentation. Additional (detailed) guidance can be found <a href="http://trac.sasview.org/wiki/ModelConvInst">here</a>.</li>
                	</ul>
                </ul>
                <ul>
                	<li>Other new features include:</li>
                	<ul>
					<li>Support for the saving and loading of simultaneous and constrained fits</li>
					<li>Loading of Save States from SasView v3.x.y using new <i>sasmodel</i> model names</li>
					<li>Support for the saving and loading of projects with 2D fits</li>
					<li>OpenCL is disabled by default but can be enabled through the Fitting menu option</li>
					<li>Data and theory fields are now independently expandable</li>
					<li><span style="color:red">Loading a project no longer appends to an existing session but instead removes all existing data, fits, and plots</span></li>
					</ul>
                </ul>

                <h3>What's new in version 4.0.1</h3>
                <ul>
                    <li>This point release fixes a critical issue in release 4.0. 
                    <b>All users of 4.0 should upgrade to 4.0.1.</b></li>
                    <ul>
                        <li>As part of the model structure refactoring a new bug 
                        was accidentally introduced that makes P(Q) * S(Q) unusable 
                        unless the background is fixed to zero (the background is 
                        multiplied by P(Q) including all the scaling factors). 
                        This behaviour is corrected in 4.0.1 and non-zero backgrounds 
                        are again possible when using S(Q). The extraneous scaling 
                        factors have also been removed.</li>
                        <li>NB: The effective radius used for S(Q) is <i>still</i> 
                        calculated (as per the documentation) automatically from 
                        P(Q) using the radius of a sphere that 
                        has the same second viral coefficient as the particle. This 
                        is only valid for particles with limited axial ratios.</li>
                    </ul>
                </ul>

                <h3>What's new in version 4.0</h3>
                <ul>
                    <li>This is the production release of 4.0 beta 1</li>
                    <ul>
                        <li>NB: The RPA model is not available in this release, but 
                        will be made available again in a future release.</li>
                    </ul>

                        <li><i>NOTE: These will be deprecated in a future version. Old
                            custom models should be converted to the new model format which 
                            is now the same as the built-in models and offers much better
                            support.</i></li>

                        <li>The active optimizer is now listed on the top of the fit panel.</li>
                        <li>Linear fits now update qmin and max when the x scale limits are
                            changed.  Also the plot range no longer resets after a fit.</li>
                    </ul>
                    <li>Bug fixes:</li>

                        <li>Fixes bug #474 resulting from changes in 3.1.1 that had introduced an error in the high-Q of slit-smeared models</li>
                        <li>Fixes bug #478 which would cause wx to run out of IDs and result in SasView crashing even if left alone</li>
                        <li>Fixes bug #479 missing help button on simultaneous/constrained fit page</li>

                    </ul>
                </ul>

                <h3>What's new in version 3.1.1</h3>
                <ul>
                    <li>Fixes bug #457 that prevented SasView from starting if the user was not connected to the internet, or was behind a proxy server</li>
                </ul>

                <h3>What's new in version 3.1.0</h3>
                <ul>
                    <li>The documentation/help has had a complete overhaul including:</li>
                    <ul>
                        <li>A completely new presentation interface (Sphinx).</li>
                        <li>Proof reading!</li>
                        <li>Updating for latest features.</li>
                        <li>A Help (or sometimes ?) button has been added to every panel, and some sub panels if appropriate, linking to the appropriate section in the documentation.</li>
                        <li>The model help has been split so that the Details button now brings up a very short pop-up giving the equation being used while HELP goes to the section in the full documentation describing the model.
                        <li>Extensive help has also been added for the new optimizer engine (see below) including rules of thumb on how and when to choose a given optimizer and what the parameters do.</li>
                    </ul>
                    <li>The optimizer engine has been completely replaced. The new optimizer still defaults to the standard Levenberg-Marquardt algorithm. However 4 other optimizers are now also available. Each starts with a set of default parameters which can be tuned. The DREAM optimizer takes the longest but is the most powerful and yields rich information including full parameter correlation and uncertainty plots. A results panel has been added to accommodate this.</li>
                    <li>The five new optimizers are:</li>
                    <ul>
                        <li>A Levenberg-Marquardt optimizer</li>
                        <li>A Quasi-Newton BFGS optimizer</li>
                        <li>A Nelder-Mead Simplex optimizer</li>
                        <li>A Differential Evolution optimizer</li>
                        <li>A Monte Carlo optimizer (DREAM)</li>
                    </ul>
                    <li>New models were added:</li>
                    <ul>
                        <li>MicelleSphCoreModel (currently residing in the Uncategorized category)</li>
                    </ul>
                    <li>Existing models were updated:</li>
                    <ul>
                        <li>LamellarPS (bug in polydispersity integration fixed)</li>
                        <li>RectangularPrismModel</li>
                        <li>RectangularHollowPrismModel</li>
                        <li>RectangularHollowPrismInfThinWallsModel</li>
                    </ul>
                    <li>A number of bugs were fixed including a thread crashing issue and an incorrect slit smearing resolution calculation.</li>
                    <li>Implemented much more robust error logging to enable much easier debugging in general but particularly the debugging of issues reported by SasView users.</li>
                </ul>

                <h3>What's new in version 3.0.0</h3>
                <ul>
					<li>The GUI look and feel has been refactored to be more familiar for Windows users by using MDI frames. Graph windows are also now free-floating</li>
					<li>Five new models have been added:</li>

					<li>The data loader now supports ILL DAT data files and reads the full meta information from canSAS file formats</li>
					<li>Redefined convention for specifying angular parameters for anisotropic models</li>
					<li>A number of minor features have been added such as permitting a log distribution of points when using a model to simulate data, and the addition of a Kratky plot option to the linear plots</li>
                    <li>Save Project and Save Analysis now work more reliably</li>
					<li>A number of bugs have also been fixed</li>  
					<li><i>BETA:</i> MAGNETIC CONTRAST supporting full polarization analysis has been implemented for some spherical and cylindrical models</li>
					<li><i>BETA:</i> Two new tools have been added:</li>
                       - A GENERIC SCATTERING CALCULATOR which takes an atomic, magnetic or SLD distribution in space and generates the appropriate 2D scattering pattern. In some cases the orientationally averaged (powder) 1D scattering can also be computed. Supported formats include: SLD or text, PDB, and OMF magnetic moment distribution file.</li></br>
                       - An IMAGE VIEWER/CONVERTER for data in image format; this reads in an image file and will attempt to convert the image pixels to data. Supported formats include: TIFF, TIF, PNG, BMP, JPG.</li>
				</ul>
