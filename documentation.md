**Help documentation:**

Our help documentation has evolved considerably over the years and includes

*   USER DOCUMENTATION - information on how to use SasView, descriptions of each model, the equations behind them and appropriate references
*   DEVELOPER DOCUMENTATION - information primarily aimed at software developers that want to interact with the SasView and Sasmodels APIs
*   RELEASE NOTES - what is new in a given version of SasView, bugs that have been fixed, and any known issues discovered during testing

Below are links to this documentation arranged by SasView version:
