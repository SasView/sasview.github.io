### How to get help

Much is documented in the help documentation. In particular, descriptions of each model, the equations used and appropriate references. This should always be the first place to go with questions. Also note that the bottom information bar on SasView often has useful information. Other places to look are:

*   [Links to our tutorials](/documentation/#tutorials) (in PDF format)
*   [The full user documentation](/docs/user/user.html) including model documentation. Also available as a [PDF download](/downloads/SasViewDocumentation_4.2.2.pdf) for version 4.2.2
*   You may contact us at: [help@sasview.org](mailto:help@sasview.org) to report bugs (in which case please also attach a SasView log file, see below) or for help using the software
*   Or try the users forum at: [users@sasview.org](mailto:users@sasview.org)
*   Check our [release notes](http://www.sasview.org/docs/user/RELEASE.html) for Known Issues
*   Visit our [issues list](https://github.com/SasView/sasview/issues?q=is%3Aissue) to view reported bugs, things being worked on or possible future ehancements
*   For the adventurous, many new features and bug fixes are available in the [latest builds](https://jenkins.esss.dk/sasview/) & may have what you are looking for

### Where to find the SasView log file

Whenever you run SasView it silently creates/appends debugging information to a log file. If you are reporting a technical problem with SasView, it can be helpful to the Development Team if you send us the log file. Where the log file resides depends on your operating system:

*   Windows: `C:\Users\your_username\sasview.txt`
*   Mac OS:
*   Linux: `~/sasview.txt`

### How to contribute

*   Contribute a fitting model to the [Model Marketplace](http://marketplace.sasview.org)
