### How to get help

Much is documented in the help documentation which is available in-program or online (see below). In particular, it contains descriptions of each model, the equations used and appropriate references, along with information on the optimisers, polydispersity functions, orientational aspects, and so on. The documentation should always be the first place to go with questions. The information bar at the bottom of the SasView window sometiumes has useful information, as does the Log Explorer in SasView version 5.

Other places to look for help are:

*   [The full user documentation](/docs/user/user.html) including model documentation. This is available as a [PDF download](/downloads/SasViewDocumentation_4.2.2.pdf) for version 4.2.2
*   Contact us at: [help@sasview.org](mailto:help@sasview.org) to report bugs (in which case please also attach a SasView log file, see below) or for help in using the software
*   Message us on [Slack](https://sasview.slack.com/)
*   Try the [Users Forum Archives](http://lists.sasview.org/pipermail/users) or even email the forum at [users@sasview.org](mailto:users@sasview.org). To join the Users Forum, click [here](http://lists.sasview.org/cgi-bin/mailman/listinfo/users)
*   Check our [release notes](http://www.sasview.org/docs/user/RELEASE.html) for Known Issues
*   Visit our [issues list](https://github.com/SasView/sasview/issues?q=is%3Aissue) to view reported bugs, things being worked on or possible future ehancements
*   For the adventurous, many new features and bug fixes are available in the [latest builds](http://builds.sasview.org) and may have what you are looking for

### Learning to use SasView

The help documentation also includes guidance on using the many different features of SasView. But in addition we have:

*   [Working with SasView](https://www.sasview.org/docs/user/working.html) documentation
*   [Written tutorials](/documentation) (in PDF format)
*   [Instructional videos](https://www.youtube.com/channel/UCxvD3ysXJ05l6MgY7YKjEFQ) (on YouTube)
*   Self-paced [online course](https://pan-learning.org/) (in Moodle)

### Where to find the SasView log file

Whenever you run SasView it silently creates/appends debugging information to a log file. If you are reporting a technical problem with SasView, it can be helpful to the Development Team if you send us the log file. Where the log file resides depends on your operating system:

*   Windows: `C:\Users\your_username\sasview.txt`
*   Mac OS:
*   Linux: `~/sasview.txt`

### How to contribute

*   Contribute a fitting model to the [Model Marketplace](https://marketplace.sasview.org)
*   Become part of our [developer community](/contribute/)!

We challenged [OpenAI](https://openai.com/)'s [ChatGPT](https://openai.com/blog/chatgpt/) to create a poem about SasView! Here is what it came up with. Enjoy!

>_SasView, oh how you shine,_  
>_A program so devine,_  
>_Analyzing neutron data with such ease,_  
>_A true gift to scientists, a true masterpiece._
>
>_Your creators, a team of the brightest minds,_  
>_Physicists and chemists at neutron facilities of all kinds,_  
>_ISIS, ESS, ILL, NIST,_  
>_Together they have crafted a tool that we can't resist._
>
>_With your help, we can see beyond,_  
>_The structure of materials, down to the bond,_  
>_Thank you SasView, for your invaluable contribution,_  
>_To the world of science, and all its resolution._
